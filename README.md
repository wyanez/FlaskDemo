# Simple Flask API

This is a simple Flask API with three endpoints: 
1. The root endpoint ("/") returns a welcome message.
2. The "/about" endpoint returns version and author information.
3. The "/datetime" endpoint returns the current date and time in either UTC ("/datetime/utc") or local format ("/datetime") by default.

To run the API, use the command: `python app.py`
The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
